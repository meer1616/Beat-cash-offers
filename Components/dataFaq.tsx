        ans: 'The difference is all in the amount of work a lender does upfront. In today’s market, real estate transactions are moving faster than ever before. In order to get a leg up on the competition, it helps if you can be as fully prepared as possible before you make an offer. With a full loan approval in hand, there is no guessing or surprises about your loan proceeds. This removes the risk for both you and the seller. '

        que: 'What is a Good As Cash Offer™?',
        ans: 'Simply put, it is an offer to buy a house that does not contain a financing contingency—so it acts as “good as cash.” We know that not every buyer can make cash offers in a competitive market, but we also know that it’s not the cash that gets sellers excited, it’s the level of certainty sellers have in your offer and ability to close the deal. When you work with us, we work with your lender to make sure that you are fully approved for your loan. Once we have confirmation, we guarantee your earnest money deposit so that you can waive your financing contingency, which makes your offer as good as cash. '
